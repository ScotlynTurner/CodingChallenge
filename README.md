Decimal to Roman Numeral Converter

## Process
I started this project by brainstorming how this kind of converter would work. By putting the rules of Roman Numerals into an algorithm, I could insure that it would work for any integer given.

Then, I crerated the functions I would need and started putting the algorithm together in code. I also made a test file to make sure everything worked properly, fixing bugs along the way.

Once everything worked correctly, I created a Main to implement user access and tested it against possible inputs.

After I made sure everything was in order, I committed my final version to GitHub!
